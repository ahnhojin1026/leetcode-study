## 📌 Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and explanations for algorithmic problems, primarily focusing on the **Blind 75** list.
The goal is not just to solve problems, but to analyze **Time/Space Complexity** and derive **Optimal Solutions** like a System Architect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Strategy
* **Primary Language:** Python 3 (Focus on Readability & Interview Efficiency)
* **Secondary Language:** C++ / Rust (Focus on Low-level Optimization) 
[algorithm study(c++)](https://solved.ac/profile/ahnhojin1026).

* **Key Principles:**
    1.  **Understand** the core problem constraints.
    2.  **Visualize** the solution (Draw it out).
    3.  **Optimize** Time & Space Complexity (Big-O Analysis).
    4.  **Implement** Clean & Pythonic Code.
